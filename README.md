Project Overview
The Automated Report Generation using Python project is designed to automatically analyze sales data and generate a professional report without manual effort. The system reads data from a CSV file, processes and analyzes the data using Python, creates a graphical representation of sales performance, and generates a formatted PDF report.
This project uses Pandas for data analysis, Matplotlib for graph visualization, and ReportLab for PDF generation. It helps in reducing manual reporting time, minimizing errors, and producing consistent and accurate reports. The solution is simple, efficient, and suitable for real-world reporting applications in business and data analysis.

How It Works

The system starts by reading sales data from a CSV file using the Pandas library.

It calculates the total sales for each product by multiplying quantity and price.

The analyzed data is then visualized as a bar chart using Matplotlib.

The generated graph is saved as an image file.

Using the ReportLab library, the program creates a PDF report.

The graph image and sales summary are inserted into the PDF.

The final output is a professionally formatted PDF report generated automatically.
